# 732A94 - Advanced R Programming  Lab 3
## Overview
Implementation of Euclidean and Dijkstra algorithm i R language by Marketos Damigos (marda352) and Christoforos Spyretos (chrsp415) for the Lab 3 of course 732A94 - Advanced R Programming.

## Contribution
Both students contributed equally for the development of the package but the commits pushed through Marketos Damigos account and machine because of hardware problems that Christophoros Spyretos had with his laptop.
